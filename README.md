# VBA-Challenge
This is the Second Module Challenge/Homework for the Data Science Course

I used essentially every cloud recordings via the Zoom VBA course week to reiterate it onto this module challenge. Heavier revisions were done to the Wednesday and Thursday sessions that helped tremendously with revising and correcting code; specially closer to the end of each session where the If loops were used. Those areas of the sessions would just help clear out a lot of the code going through the table and getting (while inputting) variables into the new table with the information following. One specific section aiding tremendously which was the "credit_charges" section of the class on Thursday.

# Microsoft Functions definitions and explanations:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.range.autofit - for the autofit feature to correct the columns width to adjust perfectly to it's contents making it legible.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/data-type-summary - helped clear out doubts and what variable terms to use when declaring them.

# Stack Overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45510730/vba-how-to-convert-a-column-to-percentages - helped format for percents.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68498912/find-the-last-row-column-in-excel-using-access-vba - helped lastrow variable, found it within the course recordings (through Closed Captions search) instructor had quickly gone through as well.

# Side Note:
This project definitely required me to sit down multiple days for multiple hours each just to look through the class sessions again to keep practicing as I am definitely far from being able to do this quicker or easier for myself, this week coming I definitely will need tutoring to make Python easier on myself as we dive deeper.
